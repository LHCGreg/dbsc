Tool for version controlling MongoDB databases
mongodbsc (DataBase Source Control for MongoDB) is a tool for creating
and updating MongoDB databases. mongodbsc uses numbered scripts written
in javascript, executed by the mongo shell, that can be stored in
source control. You can use mongodbsc to create a database by running
the scripts in order. You can also update a database to a newer
revision after adding scripts. mongodbsc stores the current
revision of the database in a metadata collection. When creating or
updating a database, you can import data from another database that
was created using mongodbsc, which is useful for getting test data
into a development database.
