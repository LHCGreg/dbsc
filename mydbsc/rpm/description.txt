Tool for version controlling MySQL databases
mydbsc (DataBase Source Control for MYSQL) is a tool for creating
and updating MySQL databases. mydbsc uses numbered scripts written
in SQL that can be stored in source control. You can use mydbsc to create
a database by running the scripts in order. You can also update a database
to a newer revision after adding scripts. mydbsc stores the current
revision of the database in a metadata table. When creating or updating
a database, you can import data from another database that was created
using mydbsc, which is useful for getting test data into a development
database. mariadb or mysql must be installed to import data but are not
required if you just want to create or update databases.
