BUILD DEPENDENCIES
------------------
DBSC uses NuGet to fetch most dependencies when building.

dbsc.Core.Antlr uses ANTLR 4 to generate a parser for import table list files. The lexer and parser are generated at build-time by Antlr. Antlr [recommends](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs#step-1-install-java-recommended) that Java is installed and on your `PATH` to improve generation performance but the fallback C# generator seems to work just fine and and is pretty quick for the small grammar dbsc uses. The generated lexer and parser are in the obj/ folder and do not get committed.

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------
Take care when adding references. Non-system references that must be present at runtime must be explicitly included in the Windows installer (Installer/installer.wxs). Linux packages will automatically pick up *.dll, *.exe, and *.config from the bin folder. License files must be explicitly included in both Windows installers and Linux packages. They are added to the Windows installer in Installer/installer.wxs and to Linux packages in pgdbsc.targets (or whatever.targets).

The Mono Linux packages on Debian are very granular with system libraries so even something innocent like System.Xml.dll must be listed as a package dependency. When adding new non-system dependencies, check what its system dependencies are using a decompiler like JetBrains DotPeek (http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/). Recursively check the system dependencies of its non-system dependencies as well. Add system dependencies to .targets file for the project in the DebianDependencyFpmFlags and RpmDependencyFpmFlags properties.

The version number to be used for executable projects is stored in <project>.targets so that it can be read during the build process and used when building the installer, Debian package, Red Hat package, and zip package.

msdbsc can only be built x86, not AnyCPU or x64 due to dependencies on 32-bit SQL Server native dlls.

oradbsc uses Oracle.ManagedDataAccess in the DebugDotNet and ReleaseDotNet configurations and System.Data.OracleClient in the DebugMono and ReleaseMono configuration. DebugDotNet/ReleaseDotNet/DebugMono/ReleaseMono are only used for oradbsc. All other programs use Debug/Release. Oracle.ManagedDataAccess does not support Mono. It requires System.Data.Entity to be installed, which Mono does not have. System.Data.OracleClient is not used on .NET because there is a short character limit for the data source part of connection strings which Oracle's ridiculous connection strings of (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = {localhost})(PORT = {1521})))(CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME = {XE}))) exceed. System.Data.OracleClient on Mono requires the Oracle native client libraries to be installed. This may require registering on Oracle's website, downloading the libraries, installing them to /usr/lib, and creating *.so symlinks to the *.so.X.Y files. You may need to increase the number of connections the Oracle server allows to prevent getting errors:

sqlplus sys@localhost AS SYSDBA
alter system set processes=300 scope=spfile;
alter system set sessions=300 scope=spfile;

and then restart the Oracle service.

oradbsc requires sqlplus to be installed.


BUILDING A ZIP PACKAGE
----------------------
You can build a .zip package using the BuildZipPackage MSBuild target.

msbuild /t:BuildZipPackage /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=AnyCPU pgdbsc.csproj

The .zip will be placed in ZipReleases/ in the project folder. The .zip will contain the contents of the bin folder except *.pdb, *.mdb, and *.xml, and any *.vshost.exe that might be there.


BUILDING AN MSI WINDOWS INSTALLER
---------------------------------
See Installer/installer_readme.txt for the project. You must have version 3.7 or higher (but less than 4.0?) of the WiX Toolset (http://wixtoolset.org/) installed and you must have the WiX binaries on your path.


RUNNING THE AUTOMATED TESTS
---------------------------
You must have NUnit 2.6.2 or higher installed and the NUnit binaries on your path. Projects called *.Tests are unit tests with no environmental dependencies. Projects called *.Integration are integration tests that require a database server to be specially set up.

Integration test projects have a readme.txt explaining setup requirements.

Test projects have a run_tests.bat and run_tests.sh script that will build the project and run the tests.



BUILDING ON LINUX WITH MONO
---------------------------
You must have the mono-complete package (Debian) or similar installed. You must have Mono version 3.0.6 or higher to build, but Mono 2.10.8.1 is the minimum supported end-user version. The higher version for build is required for NuGet to work properly. Currently Debian users must get Mono 3.0.6 from Debian Testing (Jessie). Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) has mono 3.2.8 in its repository so all is good if you're on the latest Ubuntu. At the time of this writing (2014-04-21), the latest CentOS is on mono 2.4.x, which can neither build nor run dbsc. Even the latest Fedora is only on 2.10.8, enough to run but not to build. If you want to build from one of those distros, you'll have to find a more recent version of mono somewhere.

INSTALLING ROOT CERTIFICATES INTO MONO'S CERTIFICATE STORE
-----------------------------------------------------------
For NuGet to be able to download packages when building with Mono, you must install root certificates into Mono's certificate store by running

mozroots --import --sync

HOW TO INSTALL MONO FROM DEBIAN TESTING ON DEBIAN STABLE
--------------------------------------------------------
Add this line to /etc/apt/apt.conf (create it if it does not already exist)

APT::Default-Release "stable";

Create /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list with these contents:

deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian jessie main
deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian jessie main

deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main

This lets you install selected packages from Testing without defaulting everything to Testing.

You can then use

sudo apt-get install -t testing mono-complete

MONO DEPENDENCY NOTES
---------------------
When building on non-Windows systems, pgdbsc will rely on Mono.Security being in the GAC. It is a dependency of Npgsql but is not needed by pgdbsc itself, so it is not actually referenced when building on non-Windows systems.

Why not use the system Npgsql? Because the Debian Npgsql package appears to be using an absolutely ancient version and uses the Mono version for the assembly version instead of the actual Npgsql version number.

BUILDING THE DEBIAN PACKAGE
---------------------------
To build the Debian package, you must have fpm (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm), lintian, and gzip installed.

To build the Debian package, run

xbuild /t:BuildDebianPackage "/p:Configuration=Release;Platform=AnyCPU" pgdbsc.csproj

(or whatever.csproj).

The built package will be in deb/bin/package_name_<version>.deb. Lintian is run as part of the build process. linux_common/lintian_suppress.txt contains lintian warnings/errors to ignore.

BUILDING THE RPM PACKAGE
------------------------
To build the rpm package, you must have fpm (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm), rpmbuild (in the "rpm" package in Debian and Debian-based distros), and rpmlint (in the "rpmlint" package in Debian and Debian-based distros) installed. rpmlint is currently only in Debian Testing (Jessie).

To build the .rpm package, run

xbuild /t:BuildRpmPackage "/p:Configuration=Release;Platform=AnyCPU" pgdbsc.csproj

(or whatever.csproj).

The built package will be in rpm/bin/package_name-<version>.noarch.rpm. rpmlint is run as part of the build process. linux_common/rpmlint_suppress.txt contains rpmlint warnings/errors to ignore.
