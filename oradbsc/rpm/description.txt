Tool for version controlling Oracle databases
oradbsc (DataBase Source Control for Oracle) is a tool for initializing
and updating Oracle databases. oradbsc uses numbered scripts written
in SQL that can be stored in source control. You can use oradbsc to
initialize a database by running the scripts in order. You can also
update a database to a newer revision after adding scripts. oradbsc
stores the current revision of the database in a metadata table.
